`ProblemTwo.m` and `ProblemTwoA.m` both look good. I like the amount of comments, and it's producing correct results (for the most part) - there is something very wrong on line 13 of `ProblemTwoA.m` that will mess up the calculation, do you see it? I also would like some comments in `ProblemTwo.m` addressing the questions in that assignment.
