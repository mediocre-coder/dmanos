`ProblemTwo.m` and `ProblemTwoA.m` both look good. I like the amount of comments, and it's producing correct results (for the most part) - there is something very wrong on line 13 of `ProblemTwoA.m` that will mess up the calculation, do you see it? I also would like some comments in `ProblemTwo.m` addressing the questions in that assignment.

Problem 3 checks out except that very last part with the summation of the series. You made one small, but crucial error - look at where to start the summation. After look at Problem 2, I think you're basically there. For your own education, I would make sure that you can easily write a statement that would take the difference between the altitude of the sidereal and solar day.
