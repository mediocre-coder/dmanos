function [pT,pg] = planet(m,r,sm,a)
% takes a planet's mass (in Earth masses), radius (in Earth radii),
% planet's star's mass (in Sun masses), and planet's orbital radius (in AU)
% and returns the planet's orbital period (in Earth years) and the planet's
% g (in terms of Earth's g).

% calculate orbital period
pT = a^3;

% define G
G = 6.67*10^(-11);

% calculate g
pg =
